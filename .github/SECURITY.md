# Security Policy

This project strives to follow industry best practices, ensuring a balance between a high level of security and user convenience.

## Supported Versions

We are currently providing security updates for the following versions:
- The latest commit on the `master` branch
- The two most recent release versions / tags
- Any release version / tag from the last 30 days


## Reporting a Vulnerability

We greatly appreciate your help in identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities.

If you discover a critical security vulnerability, please responsibly disclose by creating a [security advisory](https://github.com/bitcoin-tools/nodebuilder/security/advisories/new).

If you prefer to communicate outside of GitHub, create a (private) security advisory or (public) issue asking to connect over a secure channel.
