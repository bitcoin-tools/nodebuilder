For example, a commit message might look like this: `feat(ui): simplify the free space warning`.

### Shell Style Guide

Shell scripts must be POSIX-compatible and pass `shellcheck` and `shfmt` linters.

### Documentation Style Guide

Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). Documentation files must pass a markdown linter and spell check.
