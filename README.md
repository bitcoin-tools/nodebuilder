## Prerequisites

1. An active internet connection (of course)
3. A compatible operating system:
   - [macOS](https://apple.com/macos)
   - [Alpine](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Installation) Linux
   - [Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide) Linux or any derivative like [Manjaro](https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Installation_Guides)
   - [Debian](https://debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual) Linux or any derivative like [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop)
   - [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download) Linux
   - [SUSE](https://documentation.suse.com/sles/) Linux or any derivative like [openSUSE Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap/)
   - Any other system that can run our [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)
5. `bash`, which is probably already installed, or you can install with a package manager
6. `curl`, which is installed by default on macOS, or you can install with a package manager

During runtime, the script will install [dependencies](./dependencies.txt).

## What Does This Script Do?

The script performs the following actions:
1. Update the system (including reboot, if required) and install [dependencies](./dependencies.txt).
2. Download, validate, and extract Bitcoin Core.
3. Set a prune for Bitcoin Core based on the disk free space.
4. Create shortcuts for Bitcoin Core on the desktop and the "Show Applications" list.
5. Start Bitcoin Core.
6. Prevent the system from sleeping, suspending, and hibernating.
7. While the initial block download proceeds, display relevant info such as the percent synced, blocks left to sync, current chain tip date, and the free disk space remaining.
8. After the initial block download completes, tell the user that the script has finished and end the script.

## Which Files Does This Script Touch?

Before launching Bitcoin Core, this script modifies the following files:
- Any files related to installing system updates and dependencies
- Any files added by Bitcoin Core, such as the `blocks/` and `chainstate/` directories
- The downloaded Bitcoin Core archive and validation files:
  - `/tmp/<mktemp_directory>/bitcoin-<version>-<architecture>-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
  - `/tmp/<mktemp_directory>/SHA256SUMS`
  - `/tmp/<mktemp_directory>/SHA256SUMS.asc`
  - `/tmp/<mktemp_directory>/guix.sigs/`
- The validated Bitcoin Core tarball and PGP keys:
  - `~/Downloads/bitcoin-<version>-<architecture>-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
  - `~/Downloads/guix.sigs/`
- The installed binaries and other relevant files:
  - `/usr/local/bin/{bitcoind,bitcoin-qt,bitcoin-cli,bitcoin-tx,bitcoin-util,bitcoin-wallet,test_bitcoin}`
  - `/usr/local/include/bitcoinconsensus.h`
  - `/usr/local/lib/{libbitcoinconsensus.so,libbitcoinconsensus.so.0,libbitcoinconsensus.so.0.0.0}` (Linux)
  - `/usr/local/lib/{libbitcoinconsensus.0.dylib}` (macOS)
  - `/usr/local/man/man1/{bitcoind.1,bitcoin-qt.1,bitcoin-cli.1,bitcoin-tx.1,bitcoin-util.1,bitcoin-wallet.1}`
- The Bitcoin Core configuration file:
  - `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` (Linux)
  - `~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf` (macOS)
- A shortcut on the desktop and Show Applications menu:
  - `~/Desktop/bitcoin_core.desktop` (Linux)
  - `~/.local/share/applications/bitcoin_core.desktop` (Linux)
